# AIKit 🤖✨ - Bring AI Magic to Your Swift Apps, the Friendly Way!

---

Meet **AIKit** – your new Swift-powered sidekick for weaving AI smarts into iOS \& macOS apps. Born from the DNA of Vercel's awesome toolkit but reimagined with Swift's flair.

## Why You'll Heart This Library 💖

### **Swift's Best Tricks, No Cards Up Our Sleeves**

- **`async`/`await`** so smooth it feels like cheating
- **Type-safe** everything (goodbye, `Any`-xiety!)
- **Memory-smart** chats that never overstay their welcome
- **Error handling** that actually wants to help

## Getting Started (No PhD Required)

### **Installation – Quicker Than Your Morning Coffee**

Add this to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/d6stiny/AIKit.git",
    from: "1.0.0"
)
```

_Requires Xcode 16+ (because we love Swift Concurrency)_

### **First Date with AIKit**

1. Get your API key (we won't peek! 👀)
2. Pick your AI buddy: OpenAI, Anthropic, or...
3. **Wait –** missing your favorite? Send a PR!

## Features That Spark Joy 🎇

### **Chat Memory That Actually Remembers**

Our `ConversationContext` is like Dory, but useful.

### **Error Messages That Don't Make You Cry**
